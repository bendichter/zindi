# Zindi

Represent remote HDF5 NWB files as Zarr v3 via JSON reference file systems.

## What it does

Zindi reads the metadata and chunk layout of an HDF5 file (local or remote) and produces a small JSON file that describes the same data as a Zarr v3 store. The JSON contains:

- **Zarr v3 metadata** (`zarr.json` entries for every group and array)
- **Chunk references** pointing to byte ranges in the original HDF5 file (`[url, offset, size]`)
- **Inline data** for small datasets (base64-encoded)

When you open this JSON, Zindi provides a zarr v3 `Store` that fetches chunks on demand from the remote HDF5 file using HTTP Range requests. No data is copied — the original file is the source of truth.

## How it relates to Lindi

[Lindi](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/lindi) does something similar but targets Zarr v2 and creates an h5py-like shim object for use with `pynwb.NWBHDF5IO`.

Zindi instead produces a proper Zarr v3 store, following the [unified convention](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/lindi/issues/125) that aligns Lindi and hdmf-zarr. The goal is to read NWB files via `pynwb.NWBZarrIO` (once hdmf-zarr completes its [Zarr v3 migration](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf-zarr/issues/335)), eliminating the h5py shim layer.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick start

### Generate a reference file system from a remote NWB file

```python
from zindi import generate_rfs, write_rfs

url = "https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/6e7e9b91-0d66-45af-b646-dfb11e4d9967/download/"

rfs = generate_rfs(url)
write_rfs(rfs, "example.zindi.json")
```

Just pass the URL — Zindi handles remote file access internally.

### Load the JSON and read data as Zarr v3

```python
from zindi import open_rfs

root = open_rfs("example.zindi.json")

# Browse the hierarchy
print(root.attrs["neurodata_type"])  # 'NWBFile'

# Read data (fetched from remote HDF5 via byte-range requests)
spike_times = root["units/spike_times"][:]
print(spike_times.shape)  # (359781,)
```

### Generate from a local HDF5 file

If you have a local copy but want chunk references to point to a remote URL:

```python
from zindi import generate_rfs, write_rfs

rfs = generate_rfs(
    "https://example.com/data.nwb",
    local_hdf5_path="/path/to/local/data.nwb",
)
write_rfs(rfs, "data.zindi.json")
```

## DANDI support

Zindi handles DANDI API URLs automatically. The DANDI URL (which returns a 302 redirect to a presigned S3 URL) is resolved transparently, with the presigned URL cached for 10 minutes.

For embargoed datasets, set the appropriate environment variable:

```bash
export DANDI_API_KEY=your_token_here
# or for staging:
export DANDI_STAGING_API_KEY=your_token_here
```

## Unified convention

The generated JSON follows the [unified Zarr v3 convention](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf-zarr/issues/335) for representing HDF5/NWB concepts in Zarr:

| Feature | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Groups | `zarr.json` with `node_type: "group"` |
| Arrays | `zarr.json` with `node_type: "array"`, codecs pipeline |
| Scalars | `_SCALAR: true` attribute, stored as shape `[1]` |
| Soft links | `_LINKS` list on parent group: `[{"name", "source", "path"}]` |
| References in attrs | `{"_REFERENCE": {"source": ".", "path": "/target"}}` |
| NaN/Inf in attrs | Encoded as `"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`, `"-Infinity"` strings |
| Strings | `data_type: "string"` with `vlen-utf8` codec |

## Architecture

**Data flow:**

```
Remote HDF5 file
    ↓ (h5py + Remfile: read metadata and chunk layout)
JSON reference file system (.zindi.json)
    ↓ (RfsStore: zarr v3 Store implementation)
zarr.Group (read-only, chunks fetched on demand)
    ↓ (future: NWBZarrIO)
pynwb NWBFile
```

## Current limitations

This is v0.1 — the following are not yet implemented:

- Nested compound dtypes (structs within structs)
- Object references in datasets (`_DTYPE = "object"`)
- External array links (`_EXTERNAL_ARRAY_LINK`)
- Integration with `NWBZarrIO` (requires hdmf-zarr Zarr v3 migration)
- Local chunk caching
